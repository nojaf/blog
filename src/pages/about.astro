      Hey there, a bit about me: I'm an eccentric{" "}
      <strong>developer</strong> with ambitions and a progressive mindset. I'm into
      <strong>functional programming</strong> and have a strong affinity for the
      web. I have a background in <strong>dotnet</strong>{" "}
      and I'm passionate about <strong>software tooling</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="freelance">Freelancer you say?</h2>
    <p>
      That is right! These days I sail under my own banner as an{" "}
      <strong>independent</strong> professional software{" "}
      <strong>consultant</strong>.<br />
      I'm most interested in the <em>open-source</em> space, where I truly believe
      I can make a difference for you and your enterprise.
    </p>
    <h2>Open-source endeavours</h2>

    <p>
      Over the years, I've been involved in the{" "}
      <strong>F# community</strong> and I have contributed to numerous projects.<br
      />
      In 2018 I became the maintainer of the{" "}
      <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas"> Fantomas project </a>
      .<br />
      Fantomas really was my jumping point to getting involved in numerous projects.
      <br />
      That journey made me explore a lot of the{" "}
      <strong>F# tooling ecosystem</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Anojaf"
          >
            The F# compiler

          , the F# language server

            The .NET documentation

      As a <strong>software craftsman</strong>, I frequently come across new
      technologies and interesting things about code. <br />
      And every once in a while, I try to blog about my adventures.
