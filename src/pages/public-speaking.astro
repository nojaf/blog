    <h2 id="intro">Straight from the heart</h2>
    <p>
      Over the years, I've had the opportunity to participate in various shapes
      of Public speaking.
      <br />
      From webinars to online and physical conferences, I've seen a fair share and
      wish to keep track of these wonderful occasions.
      <br />
      Each and every one of them has been about a topic that is dear to me. My goal
      is to inspire, educate and help projects grow by doing these things.
      <br />
      And the best is yet to come!

    <h2 id="vite-plugin-fsharp">Building a Vite plugin for F#</h2>
    <h3>May 2024 at Func Prog Sweden</h3>
    <p>
      F# can be transpiled to JavaScript via the Fable project, offering a
      powerful alternative to vanilla JavaScript in the browser. Vite, having
      conquered the front-end world, is the preferred tool for many developers
      when starting a new front-end application.
    </p>
    <p>
      What sets Vite apart is its exceptional plugin system. The integration of
      Fable within this system presents a fascinating case study, marking a
      blend of JavaScript tooling (Node, Deno, Bun) with dotnet. In this talk,
      I'll delve into the technical aspects of running transpiled F# code in the
      browser using the Vite development server, and also discuss the developer
      experience and design considerations relevant to this use case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prepare to explore the synergies between F#, Fable, and Vite, and
      understand the craft of bridging diverse ecosystems to enhance the
      developer experience.

    <p>
      Amplifying F# is a new initiative to encourage hands-on collaboration on
      open-source F# software! We aim to inspire developers all over the world
      to chime in and make F# better in the process.

    <h2 id="ndc-london-2023">Making a difference in open-source</h2>
    <h3>January 2023 at NDC London (United Kingdom)</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm able to improve open-source software in a way where it
      really matters. In layman's terms, I'm being paid to work on open-source
      projects and features that directly benefit my customers. In this talk, I
      want to highlight the importance of giving back to something you take for
      granted because it is (mostly) free. How it looks like to contribute to
      and maintain projects in the wild.

    <h2 id="ndc-olso-2021">Formatting F# code, There and Back Again</h2>
    <h3>December 2021 at NDC Oslo (Norway)</h3>
    <p>
      In recent years code formatters have done wonders in many languages. They
      can help a language by making it easier for newcomers on the "how should
      it look like". And overall, they can avoid pointless arguments in teams.
      In a perfect world, a formatter is available with the first release of the
      language. For F# this wasn't the case. In recent years the Fantomas
      project is rising to empty that void. And given the state of the language
      and ecosystem, it can be a tough climb.

    <h3>May 2020 at JetBrains .NET Days (Online)</h3>
    <p>
      If you format F# code in Rider, a tool called Fantomas will be called to
      process this. Fantomas is open source and I am one of the maintainers of
      this project. In this session I explained how Fantomas's high-level works,
      how I got involved in this project, and how it is wired into the FSharp
      support for Rider.

    <h2 id="fable-conf-2019">A Journey into the Compiler and Tooling</h2>
    <h3>September 2019 at FableConf Antwerp (Belgium)</h3>
    <p>
      When I wanted to add the capability of compiling F# scripts to Fable, I
      had to explore the infrastructure of the compiler as well as its JS
      clients, like fable-loader and fable-splitter. In this talk we will do
      this journey together to understand how all the pieces fit together so,
      maybe in the future, you can contribute a new feature to the compiler too.
