                                From webinars to online and physical conferences, I've seen a fair share and wish to
                                keep track of these wonderful occasions.<br/>
                                Each and every one of them has been about a topic that is dear to me. My goal is to

                                My first taste of giving a talk at conference. In this short lighting talk I've talked
                                about <a href="https://fable.io">Fable</a>, the F# to JavaScript compiler.

                                Fable is an F# to JavaScript compiler powered by Babel, designed to produce readable and
                                standard code. It has an active community and can be used across the entire JavaScript
                                spectrum

                            <h3>September 2019 at FableConf Antwerp (Belgium)</h3>
                            <p>When I wanted to add the capability of compiling F# scripts to Fable, I had to explore
                                the infrastructure of the compiler as well as its JS clients, like fable-loader and
                                fable-splitter. In this talk we will do this journey together to understand how all the
                                pieces fit together so, maybe in the future, you can contribute a new feature to the
                                compiler too.</p>

                            <p>If you format F# code in Rider, a tool called Fantomas will be called to process this.
                                Fantomas is open source and I am one of the maintainers of this project. In this session
                                I explained how Fantomas's high-level works, how I got involved in this project, and how
                                it is wired into the FSharp support for Rider.</p>

                            <h3>December 2021 at NDC Oslo (Norway)</h3>
                            <p>In recent years code formatters have done wonders in many languages. They can help a
                                language by making it easier for newcomers on the "how should it look like". And
                                overall, they can avoid pointless arguments in teams. In a perfect world, a formatter is
                                available with the first release of the language. For F# this wasn't the case. In recent
                                years the Fantomas project is rising to empty that void. And given the state of the
                                language and ecosystem, it can be a tough climb.</p>
