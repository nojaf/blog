A logical next step was looking at Elm. I was first introduced to Elm at a Socrates Meetup a while ago by Thomas Coopman. To be honest I was a bit overwhelmed at the time and a bit skeptical afterwards. I decided to give Elm another shot and learned a lot by following Elm for…","fields":{"slug":"/adventures-in-elm/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-11-28","title":"Adventures in Elm","path":"2016/11/28/adventures-in-elm/","tags":["javascript","elm","fp"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Introduction Nowadays I’m into PHP & Docker. Yep that’s right this .NET boy is going wild! As I’m learning all these new concepts it became clear that you don’t really start from scratch with PHP but you choose a framework.
