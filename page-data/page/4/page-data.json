A logical next step was looking at Elm. I was first introduced to Elm at a Socrates Meetup a while ago by Thomas Coopman. To be honest I was a bit overwhelmed at the time and a bit skeptical afterwards. I decided to give Elm another shot and learned a lot by following Elm for…","fields":{"slug":"/adventures-in-elm/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-11-28","title":"Adventures in Elm","path":"2016/11/28/adventures-in-elm/","tags":["javascript","elm","fp"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Introduction Nowadays I’m into PHP & Docker.
