I started looking at F#, applied functional concepts (partial application, immutability, pure functions and so on) in JavaScript, gave RxJS a shot and fell in love with React. A logical next step was looking at Elm. I was first introduced to Elm at a Socrates Meetup a while ago by Thomas Coopman. To be honest I was a bit overwhelmed at the time and a bit skeptical afterwards. I decided to give Elm another shot and learned a lot by following Elm for…","fields":{"slug":"/adventures-in-elm/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-11-28","title":"Adventures in Elm","path":"2016/11/28/adventures-in-elm/","tags":["javascript","elm","fp"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Introduction Nowadays I’m into PHP & Docker. Yep that’s right this .NET boy is going wild! As I’m learning all these new concepts it became clear that you don’t really start from scratch with PHP but you choose a framework. I ended up choosing Laravel because it is popular, has a beautiful website and there is this thing called Laracasts. Laracasts - It’s Kinda Like Netflix for Your Career!

I recently had to revisit that project and I saw an opportunity to fiddle around with RxJS Explaining the problem The way the slideshow works is that it shows three images and moves up one frame at a time. So initially the first three images are shown and the rest are hidden.  You press the right button to move forward and the left to move backwards. Of course at the beginning of the slideshow you can’t move backwards. Thus the left button is hidden. Once you are at the end of…","fields":{"slug":"/leap-rxjs/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-03-24","title":"A leap in RxJS","path":"2016/03/24/a-leap-in-rx-js/","tags":["javascript","rxjs"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Introduction Lately I’ve been using a lot of Reactjs goodness in my side projects. React is only the V in a modern day MVW (Model, View Whatever) pattern and that’s an interesting subject. Facebook uses its own Flux library/pattern/architecture to cope with the other stuff, however there seem to be a lot of different opinions when it’s comes to flux. One of those flux variants is Redux, created by Dan Abramov and others. If you never heard of Redux or don’t really know how it works, I suggest you watch these videos first.
