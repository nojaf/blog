In this blogpost I would like to show that the new hooks can easily be used in combination with Fable. Disclaimer: Hooks are an experimental proposal to React, currently available in , and the api is not final yet. Use at your own risk. useState() A first example of a hook is useState(). When the  hook is called, we receive a variable representing the state and a function to update the state.

There is a new and shiny global .NET Core cli tool. Install: dotnet tool install -g fantomas-tool The  executable will be added to your path. Another new feature is the —preserveEOL option. This will respect additional newlines after formatting. You can check the release notes for all changes in the 2.8 version. Last but not least there is a rumor that the project might move to the fsprojects organization. This could lead to more people being involved in the project. Many thanks…","fields":{"slug":"/fantomas-2-8/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-07-07","title":"Fantomas 2.8: global .NET Core cli tool!","path":"2018/07/07/fantomas-global-cli-tool/","tags":["open-source","fsharp"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Introduction As part of the F# mentorship program my mentor Anthony Lloyd and I have been working on the Fantomas project. Fantomas is like prettier or elm-format but for F#. It was originally created by Anh-Dung Phan and people have suggested that it could be a part of the F# Compiler Service. Fantomas is like prettier or elm-format but for F#. .NET Core The source code of Fantomas is quite advanced so our approach is to focus first on improving the project in general.

What if I told you it isn’t all that difficult? TLDR; How to user Docker with Fable. Docker So the first step with Docker images is that you check whether a suiting image that fits your needs already exists. When I checked Docker Hub for any recent images with the Fable tool chain I didn’t really find anything that works with Fable 1.x. I accepted the fact that I would have to create the image myself. If you check the docs for requirements, we’ll need: .NET Core Node js Mono Docker compose…","fields":{"slug":"/fable-docker/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-01-20","title":"Building Fable apps inside a Docker container","path":"2018/01/20/building-fable-apps-inside-a-docker-container/","tags":["fable","docker","fsharp"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Introduction 2016 for me personal was the year the I came in serious contact with functional languages. I started looking at F#, applied functional concepts (partial application, immutability, pure functions and so on) in JavaScript, gave RxJS a shot and fell in love with React. A logical next step was looking at Elm. I was first introduced to Elm at a Socrates Meetup a while ago by Thomas Coopman. To be honest I was a bit overwhelmed at the time and a bit skeptical afterwards. I decided to give Elm another shot and learned a lot by following Elm for…","fields":{"slug":"/adventures-in-elm/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-11-28","title":"Adventures in Elm","path":"2016/11/28/adventures-in-elm/","tags":["javascript","elm","fp"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":5,"skip":10}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518"],"slicesMap":{}}
