I helped out with the organization of FableConf in Antwerp, gave a webinar at JetBrains and was able to release Fantomas 3.0.\nTo wrap up the decade I’m writing this post as part of the F# Advent Calendar in English 2019.\nI had fun last year and I wish to continue this trend.

Today you created a build script for compiling Fable projects on Travis CI.\nUsing a Docker image you maintain it is pretty easy to set up a Travis CI process.\nThis blogpost is meant to capture what you knew then in case you sorta forgot. The good part Once you logged in to Travis, create a project by selecting a repository. Don’t worry you log in with your GitHub account and hit the add button.\nThey know you are you and you get to choose a repository you have on GitHub.

I’m very grateful to be a part of this and I hope you will enjoy this one as much as I have enjoyed the others. Today I would like to show you how you can create VS Code extension from scratch using Fable. Along the way we write some code that will extend the Markdown syntax. Project setup Code extension To get started we will follow the general approach of scaffolding a new extension. Using the yeoman generator we will scaffold a new JavaScript extension.

In this blogpost I would like to show that the new hooks can easily be used in combination with Fable. Disclaimer: Hooks are an experimental proposal to React, currently available in , and the api is not final yet. Use at your own risk. useState() A first example of a hook is useState(). When the  hook is called, we receive a variable representing the state and a function to update the state.

Fantomas is like prettier or elm-format but for F#. It was originally created by Anh-Dung Phan and people have suggested that it could be a part of the F# Compiler Service. Fantomas is like prettier or elm-format but for F#. .NET Core The source code of Fantomas is quite advanced so our approach is to focus first on improving the project in general.

What if I told you it isn’t all that difficult? TLDR; How to user Docker with Fable. Docker So the first step with Docker images is that you check whether a suiting image that fits your needs already exists. When I checked Docker Hub for any recent images with the Fable tool chain I didn’t really find anything that works with Fable 1.x. I accepted the fact that I would have to create the image myself. If you check the docs for requirements, we’ll need: .NET Core Node js Mono Docker compose…","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-01-20","title":"Building Fable apps inside a Docker container","path":"2018/01/20/building-fable-apps-inside-a-docker-container/","tags":["fable","docker","fsharp"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"fable"}},
